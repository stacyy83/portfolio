                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>Our goal is to recreate  this website named ComeOn5678, which is a website to allow  dancers to share and view the dance  events in Taiwan. Because ComeOn5678 was not  managed since 2017 and a new competitor appeared in 2018, we deem that the time is now right to improve this website and modify its functions.</p>

            <div class="content__section">

                    <h2>Designed for  whom?</h2>
                    <p>Dancers and people who are interested in gaining  new information concerning  dance events</p>
                </div>

            <div class="content__section">

                    <ol>
                        <li>The function of following other people’s pages.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>The old version of ComeOn5678 was equipped with  the function to allow  users to follow other people’s pages and  acquire the information immediately, once the page released new events. However, we discovered  that users nowadays tend to use Facebook  or other social media platforms, and they usually follow the pages they like on these platforms.  It has duly resulted in  the function of  ComeOn5678 becoming useless.</p>
                    <em>Add:</em>

                            <span>Having responsive web design.</span>
                            <p>The society has  changed; people use  smartphones more frequently than before. Therefore, we need to have responsive web design  for ComeOn5678 in order to portray  the correct layout when users view  our website on a phone.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span>Timeline</span>
                            <p>We believe  that the main purpose of users entering ComeOn5678 is to view and search for the information concerning dance events. Thus, we need to strengthen this requirement  by adding a timeline and maintaining  the calendar we previously had.  These can assist  users  in viewing the entire events more clearly and quickly in different ways.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span>Combine with social media platforms, such as Facebook</span>
                            <p>We discovered  that Internet users use Facebook the most, thus  we decided to share our event information  by posting it on our Facebook fan page on a weekly basis. This post organizes the whole events in a week on ComeOn5678. That is, users on Facebook can follow our fan page and  acquire the latest information  each week. Besides, we also hyperlink our website address within  the post to allow more users to enter  ComeOn5678, thus viewing more events, which will be held  in the future.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <em>Strengthen:</em>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Share information on our website both easily and quickly.</li>
                        <p>We already have a member system within the old version of the site; however, users were unwilling to spend time on signing up for an  account in order to post the information on ComeOn5678. Therefore, we allow users to sign up by using their existing Facebook account, thus allowingour process to become easier and quicker than before as well as enhancing  the willingness of users to post upon the site.</p>
