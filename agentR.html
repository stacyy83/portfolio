                    <p>I had the initial  concept of the Agent R game and designed the main characters in a four-person  team. Moreover,  I additionally  worked as a back-end programmer and with part of the front -end programming, such as the animation of our characters. </p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Interested in somatosensory interactive technology.</li>
                        <li>Inspired by a web game called SuperSyncSports,which was created by Google.</li>
                        <li>Replace the keyboard with the phone.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>During that time, we were inspired by the web game entitled Super Sync Sports, which was created by Google. It is a web game in which players can simultaneously enter the website on a smartphone and computer, then play the game together by using their own phone
                        in order to control their character within the game. Furthermore, somatosensory interactive technology is an innovative technology for us. Therefore, we want to collate these ideas together, thus creating a web game that contains somatosensory interaction.

                    <em>1. To avoid issues that can occur with browsers</em>
                    <p>Our research showed that players often close browsers or go back to a previous page accidentally while playing games. In order to address this problem, we came up with the idea of using a smartphone app to control the game, allowing players to access the same features the would have in the browser but without the associated risks.</p>
                    <em>2. To enhance the challenge of our project</em>
                    <p>We wanted to combine different platforms (the Web through browsers and an application on a smartphone) to create a new, unique gaming experience and more possibilities through this blend. Also, this decision forced us to embrace the challenge of improving our skills across a greater range of disciplines.</p>

                    <h2>How it works?</h2>
                    <p>The website and the app connect through the use of a database. For the website, we used PHP to help us read and write the values in the database. We also used this technique for the verification process on the app. For the game's start-up, we used Java JDBC to build a server on a local machine in order to improve the speed of passing values, and used a socket to send the values that we needed from the app to server, allowing the server to write the values in the database. Finally, we also used the server to read the values in the database, then pass them to the app on smartphone via socket.

                    <p class="_mb50">Players are required to  control the board rotation between each pillar by controlling the gradient of their phone in order to allow  the game character to continuously  move forward.

                    <h2>Problems and solutions</h2>
                    <em>How does the app pass values to the website quickly and smoothly?</em>
                    <p>Initially, we wanted to set up our server and website on a cloud platform and use HTTP POST to pass values. However, we faced the following problems:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>It missed some values and was unstable when the connection weak.</li>
                        <li>It put a heavy burden on the server.</li>
                        <li>It was hard to maintain the server on a cloud platform.</li>
                        <li>Databases and websites on free cloud platforms can crash easily.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>In order to provide smooth and immediate interaction to players, the most important thing in our project was the quality and speed of the passing values between the devices. With this in mind, we set our server on a local machine, using a socket and Java JDBC as the tool for passing values from the database. There were two advantages to this: First, we could maintain the server more easily, and second, the combination of JDBC and the socket provided a stable connection that improved the speed at which values were passed.</p>
