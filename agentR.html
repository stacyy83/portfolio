                    <p>Agent R is a web game that can be controlled by an  app on the smartphone. It allows  two players to play and contains Somatosensory interactive technology to control the slope of the board in the game in order to allow  the character to consistently  move forward.</p>

                    <h2>Role</h2>
                    <p>I had the initial  concept of the Agent R game and designed the main characters in a four-person  team. Moreover,  I additionally  worked as a back-end programmer and with part of the front -end programming, such as the animation of our characters. </p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Interested in somatosensory interactive technology.</li>
                        <li>Inspired by a web game called Super Sync Sports,  which was  created by Google.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>During that  time, we  were inspired by the web game  entitled Super Sync Sports,  which was created  by Google. It is a web game in which  players can simultaneously enter  the website on a smartphone and computer,  then play the game together by using their own phone in order to control their character within the game.  Furthermore, somatosensory interactive technology is an innovative technology for us. Therefore, we want to collate  these ideas together, thus creating a web game that contains somatosensory interaction.</p>
